Introduction
============

This package facilitates community detection of networks and builds on the
package :mod:`igraph`, referred to as ``ig`` throughout this documentation.
Although the options in the package are extensive, most people are presumably
simply interested in detecting communities with a robust method that works
well. This introduction explains how to do that.

For those without patience (and some prior experience), if you simply want to
detect communities given a graph ``G`` using modularity, you simply use

.. testsetup::
   
   G = ig.Graph.Erdos_Renyi(100, p=5./100); 

>>> partition = louvain.find_partition(G, louvain.ModularityVertexPartition);

That's it.

Why then should you use this package rather than the Louvain algorithm
:func:`community_multilevel` built into :mod:`igraph`? If you want to use
modularity, and you work with a simple undirected, unweighted graph, then
indeed you may use the built-in method. For anything else, the functionality is
not built-in and this package is for you.

For those less familiar with :mod:`igraph`, let us work out an example more
fully. First, we need to import the relevant packages:

>>> import igraph as ig
>>> import louvain

Let us then look at one of the most famous examples of network science: the
Zachary karate club (it even has a prize named after it):

>>> G = ig.Graph.Famous('Zachary')

Now detecting communities with modularity is straightforward, as demonstrated
earlier: 

>>> partition = louvain.find_partition(G, louvain.ModularityVertexPartition)

You can simply plot the results as follows:

>>> ig.plot(partition) # doctest: +SKIP

.. image:: figures/karate_modularity.png

In this case, the algorithm actually finds the optimal partition (for small
graphs like these you can check this using
:func:`~ig.Graph.community_optimal_modularity` in the :mod:`igraph` package),
but this is generally not the case (although the algorithm should do well).
Although this is the optimal partition, it does not correspond to the split in
two factions that was observed for this particular network. We can uncover that
split in two using a different method: :class:`~louvain.CPMVertexPartition`:

>>> partition = louvain.find_partition(G, louvain.CPMVertexPartition,
...                                    resolution_parameter = 0.05);
>>> ig.plot(partition) # doctest: +SKIP

.. image:: figures/karate_CPM.png

Note that any additional ``**kwargs`` passed to :func:`~louvain.find_partition`
is passed on to the constructor of the given ``partition_type``. In this case,
we can pass the ``resolution_parameter``, but we could also pass ``weights`` or
``node_sizes``.

This is the real benefit of using this package: it provides implementations for
six different methods (see :ref:`Reference`), and works also on directed and
weighted graphs. In addition, it also provides flexible functionality for
customizing to some extent the optimisation routines (see :ref:`Advanced`).
Finally, it also allows to work with more complex multiplex graphs (see
:ref:`Multiplex`).
